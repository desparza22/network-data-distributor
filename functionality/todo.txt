add functions for stopping socket_communicator from receiving messages

write test for socket_communicator (where multiple threads are sending random messages to each other,
then checking that the received messages align with the sent ones. each thread can close its connection
with another once it has sent its last message to that other node)

implement email_communicator? or jump into implementing the protocol, whichever sounds more interesting
